# Learning-Curves

This is the repository for replicating simulations from the "Mapping the Learning Curve" paper.

The `Notebook` folder contains Jupyter notebooks for Gesture and NLP Pairwise Classification simulations.

The `RNN Simulation` folder contains Python scripts for executing 25 repetitions for each simulation.

The `Visualization and Analysis` folder contains R scripts for visualizing the multi-dimensional learning curves and demonstrates how to use the four measures (**start**, **max**, **tmax**, and **end-start**) to further visualize and conduct statistical inference on the constructed learning curves.
